# 🌐 **Polyglot-Calculators**

### A multi-language hub for mathematical engineering and learning

This is both a school for learners and an exhibition hall for experts.

Polyglot-Calculators is a community-driven, modern hybrid project that showcases how mathematical calculators and algorithms are implemented across different programming languages.

## 🚀 **What This Project Offers**

Polyglot-Calculators is no longer just a code playground -- it is an *engineering showcase* and a *learning playground*.

### 🏆 **Showcase**

A curated space containing high-quality, tested, advanced-level projects.
Examples include:

* Cryptography calculators
* Scientific calculators
* Matrix operation tools
* Numerical analysis projects

### 🛝 **Playground**

A beginner-friendly sandbox where making mistakes is part of the learning process.

* Basic arithmetic calculators
* "Good First Issue" contributions
* Small Git practice tasks
* Introductory algorithm examples

Both sections are fully open to community contributions. Our goal is to help learners grow while giving experienced developers a place to display their engineering work.
